Welcome to Spring, your friendly AI ChatBot! Spring is designed to chat with you on a wide range of topics and even recommend songs. Let's dive into how this works and how you can use it. üéâ

## How it Works

Spring is powered by the OpenAI GPT-3 model and comes with a few handy features:

- **ChatBot Mode**: Engage in a conversation with Spring. Ask questions, seek advice, or just chat for fun.

- **YouTube Video Player**: Spring can play YouTube videos for you. Just ask it to play a song, and it will open the video in your web browser.

- **Voice Assistant Mode**: Activate Spring's voice assistant mode and control it with your voice commands.

## Getting Started

To use Spring, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-chatbot.git
   cd spring-chatbot
   
2. **install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using 'pip' in a Virtual Enviourment 

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment 
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install the required packages

3. **Configuration**: Create a config.json file in the project directory with your OpenAI API key and a custom prompt (as specified in the provided example).

   ```bash
   {
    "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "prompt": "Your custom prompt here..."

    Type your message/question.

    Spring will respond with a thoughtful answer.

**YouTube Video Player**

    To play a song on YouTube, type: /play {Song Name} (e.g., /play Despacito).
